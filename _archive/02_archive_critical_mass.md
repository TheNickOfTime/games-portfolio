# Introduction
Critical Mass is a relatively simple mini game, where you control a small star that travels around space eating up matter to get bigger and bigger. This was a a quick project completed by myself over the course of a few days. This game took **3rd place prize** at *Academy of Art University’s Spring Show* for Game Prototype in 2018.

# Summary

## Challenge
This game was made for a class focused on rapid prototyping. The prompt for this particular project was to make a top-down shooter style game, but there had to be some kind of “twist” to it. This twist could be tweaking the genre, or having an unexpected story twist.

I was already working on studying and replicating *Hotline Miami*, so I wanted to take this particular project in a different direction

## Solution
I decided that my first twist would be taking the top-down genre and removing the violent aspects of it. I had always enjoyed games that are passive/tranquil, so the game’s main focus became collecting, with only occasional threats. I thought a good theme would be playing as a star, traveling through space, trying to get bigger by collecting matter. Rather than shoot, the player would control a solar flare.

Once I had chosen the space theme, I thought that when the player reaches their collection goal, it would be a fun second twist on the win condition to have the player’s star implode from reaching critical mass.

## Result
Critical Mass became a game where you play as a small star, traveling around the universe, collecting “space-bits” to become bigger and bigger – that is, until you become too big and you have to start all over again. While the game is pretty simple, people who have played it have told me it is engaging and relaxing to play.

This project was actually very fun to work on. Because the scope of it was relatively small, I was able to take time to focus on making smaller details like reactions, and controlling the solar flare feel more rewarding.

# Highlights

Since I was removing the shooting aspect of the top-down shooter genre, I needed a different way for the player to interact with the world. Since the focus of this game was shifted away from violence, I thought a good alternative to a traditional weapon would be tool to help the player collect more space-bits. To match the theme, the player controls a solar flare with their mouse pointer that acts as a collection net. While the execution of it looks much more tentacl-ey than solar flarish, it became a very engaging aspect of the gameplay.

Aside from being a simple collection tool, the flare is used as a defense mechanism against larger objects that are pulled towards the player. While I wanted to remove the violent aspects of the top-down shooter genre, I wanted to retain low-risk threats to vary the gameplay. If the larger objects hit the player, they lose just a small amount of their mass, nothing too serious, though you don't wanna get hit multiple times in a row. Fortunately they are pretty easy to hit, and the reward for hitting them with your solar flare is a nice little kaboom and a healthy deposit of space-bits to be eaten up.

One of the things I wanted to feel rewarding was how the player's progress in collecting space-bits is represented. The first way I did this was by gradually increasing the player's size as more matter is collected. I scaled it so the player grows more rapidly at the start, so the impact is felt immediately. To compensate for the slower growth later in the game, I thought it would be interesting to have the planet's color change over time as well - not to mention that stars actually change color at different points in their lifecycle. I also wanted the player to feel the impact of their size in game too - so as the player grows, their gravitational pull radius inscreases too, allowing the player to collect more space-bits that are nearby.
