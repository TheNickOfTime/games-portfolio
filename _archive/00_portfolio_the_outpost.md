# Introduction

The Outpost is a comprehensive, yet adaptable, Game Design Document for a unique Zombie Survival FPS. I constructed this in-depth plan from the ground up over the course of a semester. I have laid out the details from the core gameplay loops, to the narrative, down to suggested individual stats of the weapons present in the game.
