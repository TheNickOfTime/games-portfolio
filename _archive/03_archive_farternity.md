Fart-ernity was an entry into the GMTK Game Jam 2018. The premise was to make a game of a certain genre while having it lack a signature mechanic of that genre.

[Garry McGee](https://garrymcgee.com/), [Elijah Mazur](https://www.elijahmazur.com/) and myself decided to make a stealth genre game without any physical objects to hide behind. The theme we applied was a frat party setting, but you as a party-goer is overflowing with gas. Depending on what kind of fart you have coming down the pipes, you need to utilize various distractions in the room to cover up your fart. If you choose ineffecive distractions, you “clout” goes down. When you run out of clout, you get kicked out of the party!

This was a fun and silly project to work on. It is pretty simple, but it is fun to play for a while. Mission accomplished.
