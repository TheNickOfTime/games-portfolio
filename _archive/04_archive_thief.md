A Thief’s Tale is a semester-long collaborative project that was worked on by a group of my peers as a class. Primarily I worked on the second area of the game, called “The Courtyard.” I worked with Garry McGee to completely rework this area from the ground up, from what it had been from the previous semester. I am mostly satisfied with the improvements that we made.

Unfortunately this project was extremely strained for resources, namely programming help, to lay the foundation systems of the game. As a result my focus was often shifted away from design in order to build a particular system, fix a game-breaking bug or what have you. The result is that this is not my most refined work, but nonetheless I am still proud of how I and the rest of my team persevered through the difficulties and challenges we faced throughout the semester.

This was overall a great learning experience for me. I only wish that my team and I had just a bit more time and resources to make this game better!
