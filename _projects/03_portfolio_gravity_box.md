# Summary
This project was made using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) during a monthly design challenge, with the following prompts:
- Thematic Prompt: Space
- Mechanical Prompt: Gravity

Initially I toyed around with some ideas based on the gravitational pull of planets, but ultimately I found the ideas I came up with kind of shallow, or too large in scope. Then I came up with this puzzle box - the premise is simple, you have to rotate the box and a ball inside will fall according to gravity. Using the various obstacles inside of the box, you have to navigate the ball from the start point towards a goal point.

Overall I am really happy with this little game. It is deceptively simple - both mechanically, and in terms of creating it. This was also my first substantial project that I have made with Godot, and to say the least, I am a fan now. I hope to return to this project at some point and create additional content for it!
